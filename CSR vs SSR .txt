In Server Side Rendering (SSR) the HTML components of the webpage are generated on the server-side. When a browser requests a SSR web page, 
the browser receives a fully formed HTML web page with the HTML components already created.


n Client side rendering(CSR), the HTML components are generated on the client-side by executing Javascript code in the browser.

and primarily contains the link to the React/Vue JavaScript bundle,
