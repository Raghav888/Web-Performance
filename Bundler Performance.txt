1. Bundle Splitting
Bundle splitting is the process of creating multiple, smaller bundles rather than one large bundle.

A larger bundle can lead to an increased amount of loading time, processing time, and execution time. Users on low-end devices or slower networks will see a significant increase in loading time before the bundle has been fetched.

To avoid larger bundles, we can tell the bundler to create multiple, smaller bundles, instead of bundling everything into one big file.

2. Tree Shaking
With tree shaking, we can reduce the bundle size by eliminating dead code.
Tree shaking is aimed at removing unused code from a JavaScript bundle. 
Bundlers can automatically detect dead code, to exclude this code from the final bundle.
